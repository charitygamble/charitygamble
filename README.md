# Hi there, I'm Charity Gamble! 👋

🚀 **Front-End Web Developer** | 🌎 **Based in Colorado Springs** | 💡 **Passionate about responsive, accessible web development**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a front-end web developer who loves to create responsive, accessible websites. While my main focus is using the [11ty](https://11ty.dev) static site generator, I am also well-versed in the use of self-hosted [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). I am always looking to learn new technologies.
